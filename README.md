    Problem (i)
    Given two integers A and B, print A+B.
    Input format:
    The first line of input consists of a single integer T: denoting the number of test cases.
    Then, T lines follow, each of the lines consist of two integers A and B.

    Output format:
    Print Case number and result of A+B in following format ->
    Case x: RESULT
    where x is the case number, and RESULT is result of A+B

    Constraints:
    1≤T≤10
    0≤A,B≤1012

    Problem (ii)

    Given n integers ai to an, print their summation (ai+ ai+1 +ai+2+…+ an). I.E: print
    ∑_(i=0)^n▒〖a(i)〗
    Input format:
    The first line of input consists of a single integer T: denoting the number of test cases.
    Every test case starts with an integer n.
    Then n numbers follow
    Output format:
    Print Case number and result of summation in following format ->
    Case x: RESULT
    where x is the case number, and RESULT is result of summation (ai+ ai+1 +ai+2+…+ an)

    Constraints:
    1≤T≤10
    1≤n≤100
    1≤ai≤1012
